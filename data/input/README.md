# Input Files

This directory contains data on tax auctions/foreclosures in Kansas City (prefixed with "K" plus year) and Independence (prefixed with "I" plus year). Both municipalities now provide Excel spreadsheets after each annual tax auction containing the data previously only available in PDF copies of court decrees. The first sheet of each spreadsheet contains the key data, and it has been saved as a CSV file in each case to make it slightly easier to script.

## Archive
The archive subdirectory contains the old input files produced through a more manual process of parsing court decree PDFs and then reviewing that parsed data for imperfections due to scanning and OCR issues.
